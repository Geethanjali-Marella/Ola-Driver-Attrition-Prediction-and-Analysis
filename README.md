# Ola-Driver-Attrition-Prediction-and-Analysis

Developed a predictive analytics solution for driver attrition using ensemble learning techniques. The project involved data preprocessing, feature engineering, and the application of machine learning models (Random Forest and XGBoost) to classify and analyze factors influencing driver retention. The insights generated helped design targeted strategies to reduce attrition rates and improve operational efficiency.
